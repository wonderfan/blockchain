# Blockchain in Rust

The basic elements of new language are its compiler, standard library and dependency management. We can create target software or 
implement our idea with the help of these fundmental elements.

There is no garbage collector in rust programming language. The variable is automatically destroyed when it is out the scope and 
never referered any more.

The standard library in rust language is very small. It only includes some aspects like memory allocation, primitive types, operation system, collections, and etc. Most of basic functionalities are offered by third parties and community. The standard library 
is treated as strict as possible.

The project can be managed by cargo command. The git is used for code version control.
