## Java

The java source codes incorporates compiler and runtime. They are implemented by cpp language. In the cpp language, the class has private, protect and public three areas. The class prototype is declared in the header file. Its concrete methods are defined the cpp suffix file. One unit is composed of two parts: header file and implementation file.

The java source code is related to virual machine. The javac source code is related to code compilation. The header file should be examined at the first step because the header file has all of state and actions. The share source codes are irrelevant to computer architecture. The types, variables and functions are defined in the header file and they help to lanuch the virtual machine. The main function is the entry point to start the program. The type is defined by the cpp language and it has the counterpart in the java language.

The bootstrap steps are executed in the sequentail order. The virtual machine is initialized in the final step. 

## PHP

The main directory is the entry point to php compiler and executor. The interfaces are specified by api. The zend directory is the implementation of php specification. In c language, the type is before the variable name. The php source code elements are described by c language types. The compile function is provided for several scenarios. 

## Python

The compiler has abstract syntax tree, code segment, compile procedures, operation codes, memory management and symbol table. 

## Shell

The configure is shell script which can do some check and preparation work. The configuration step is finished by configuration script. All of configuration work can be put into configure script.
