The elrond chain uses k-framework to verify its smart contract. The chain repositpry is located at [elrond](https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/elrond-go). This chain has Java SDK to interact with it. The contract divides into system contracts and user contracts. The system contracts are bound with predefined constant address.

The avm is virtual machine which can run the Java contract codes. The storage system is on the basis of graph structure. The code link is here [avm](https://github.com/aionnetwork/AVM)
